I've been somewhat interested in differential geometry since my cousin's
husband, who did his PhD in astrodynamics, first explained the idea to me
several years ago.

This page will start out as notes taken from *Functional Differential
Geometry*, by Sussman and Wisdom. I've **loved** Abelson and Sussman's
*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, and I'm hoping to
find that the humor and accessibility of that book have carried through
into Sussman's other work. Initial indications are positive.
