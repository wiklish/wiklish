This is the Wiklish Hack, a wiki for tracking and sharing hack 
progress. Its current contributors are [@bwr](http://www.benwr.net) and
[@jpo](https://github.com/jpouellet).

# Goals

The Wiklish Hack is meant to be an ethereal reincarnation of the
"Weeklish Hack", a group that met every once in a while in
Blacksburg, Virginia. Some members have since departed, while
others are still around, but this is meant to be a place
for a small group of people to share what they're working on
or playing with.

## Issues

Issues/stories are tracked on the [todo page](todo).

# Organization

The wiki is statically generated by [Urubu](http://urubu.jandecaluwe.com/),
and the canonical version lives
[on GitHub](https://github.com/wiklish/wiklish) (although it can be easily
viewed or published in a variety of ways).

Site organization is however you want it to be! It's recommended that
(at least for personal projects) you use a personal directory (e.g. [bwr](bwr))
when appropriate.

# Contributing

Anyone can fork this project and run a similar thing for themselves (such
is the nature of DVCS), but if you'd like to contribute to the canonical
version, feel free to ask a current administrator to add you to the wiklish
organization on Github, or to submit a pull request.

## Howto

Working on this project requires a unix-ish system with
[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make), [Python](https://python.org),
and [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) installed; the rest is taken care
of when you first run `make build`.

To build an HTML copy of the site, run `make build`. This should give you a
directory, `_build/`, containing the resultant static HTML.

To serve the content locally (and automatically rebuild the site when changes
are made to a `.md` file), run `make serve`. `^C` (or `Ctrl-C` for you
non-true-believers) should kill the server and the rebuilding service.

If you have commit access to the website, you can run `make publish` to
push your changes to the real world. It's *highly recommended* that you only
do this after verifying that your pages look the way you want them, and
are generated correctly. If you run `make publish` and not everything is
as it should be, you may accidentally push an empty site (and this empty
site will overwrite the current site contents until someone fixes it).
